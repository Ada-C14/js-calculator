# JS Calculator

<!-- Instructors: The checkmarks are already there, so just delete them for any line items that aren't met. -->

## Major Learning Goals/Code Review

<!-- Instructors: Feel free to practice creating specific feedback by referencing a line of code if you'd like. For example, you may say something like "nice custom method in `calculator.rb` line 42." This is optional. -->

| Criteria | yes/no, and optionally any details/lines of code to reference |
| --- | --- |
| Correctly uses conditionals (`if`/`else`/`elsif` or other kinds). | ✔️?
| Correctly uses variables, and only uses `const` and `let` variables. The program uses `const` when possible. The program never uses `var`. | ✔️?
| Correctly creates and uses functions appropriately. | ✔️?
| Practices best-practices in JavaScript syntax. There are semi-colons at the end of most lines that need semi-colons. | ✔️?
| Practices best-practices in JavaScript naming conventions, and uses camelCase for variable names and function names. | ✔️?

## Functional Requirements

<!-- Instructors: This project's manually grading is a bit of a pain. To help, you may have a list of common example input variables to copy/paste. There's a structure of input variables and function names in the "hints" section, but this project doesn't have requirements on how to structure everything, so ymmv. -->

<!-- Instructors: Don't forget to npm install, or npm install prompt if the student did the optional enhancement for user input. -->

| Functional Requirement | yes/no |
| --- | --- |
| The program can read two numbers and an operator and perform addition | ✔️?
| The program can read two numbers and an operator and can perform subtraction | ✔️?
| The program prints feedback to the user when attempting to divide by zero, and the program does not give an error | ✔️?

## Overall Feedback

| Overall Feedback | Criteria | yes/no |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Green (Meets/Exceeds Standards) | 4+ in Code Review && 2+ in Functional Requirements | 
| Yellow (Approaches Standards) | 2+ in Code Review && 2+ in Functional Requirements, or the instructor judges that this project needs special attention | 
| Red (Not at Standard) | 0,1 in Code Review or 0,1 in Functional Reqs, assignment is breaking/doesn’t run with less than 5 minutes of debugging, or the instructor judges that this project needs special attention | 

<!-- ### Additional Feedback -->

<!-- Instructors, feel free to ignore this section if there's nothing else to add. -->

## Code Style Bonus Awards

<!-- Instructors: Please strike a balance between liberal/stingy with these. These are simply built-in pieces of positive feedback; use this to encourage and push students towards a cleaner code style! -->
